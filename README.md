Problem statement:  Market Entry Strategy Optimization Tool( Marico Ltd wants an automated tool to analyze sales data from 500 existing products in six categories for potential market entry
into the UAE and USA. The tool should identify best and worst performing categories, extract key attributes, and present insights for strategic decision-making. It needs to efficiently process data,
conduct analysis, visualize trends, and generate user-friendly reports)

Approach: To develop an automation tool for Marico Ltd's market entry strategy, start by using SQL for data aggregation and cleaning, ensuring all data for the 500 products across six categories in both
the UAE and USA is accurate and standardized. Next, use Python along with libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis. Apply regression and clustering techniques to analyze sales data,
utilizing Python’s statistical capabilities. For visualizations, leverage Matplotlib to create graphs and charts that illustrate data trends and performance metrics.

Define KPIs such as sales volume, growth rate, market share, and profitability to evaluate the performance across categories. Utilize Streamlit to build interactive dashboards that allow real-time data exploration and visualization,
making it easier for stakeholders to understand and make data-driven decisions.

Automate the generation of comprehensive reports by integrating the OpenAI API for summarizing insights and generating natural language explanations of data patterns. Develop and test this tool using environments like PyCharm and Google Colab,
which provide robust platforms for coding, debugging, and collaboration. This approach ensures a streamlined workflow from data cleaning to insight generation, all tailored to optimize Marico Ltd’s market entry strategy.
